# Algorithms Visual Testing Interface

A C# Windows Forms application (.NET Framework) designed to **visualize, test, and compare algorithms** interactively. This open UI design allows users to run multiple algorithms side-by-side and analyze their **time and space complexity** in real-time.

## Features

-**Main Menu Form**: Central control panel to navigate through all algorithm modules.
-**Modular Forms**: Each algorithm is implemented in its own form with input/output controls.
-**Multi-Window Comparison**: Run multiple forms simultaneously to compare algorithms visually.
-**Complexity Tracking**: Display basic insights about time complexity per algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
- **Design**: Multi-form architecture with dynamic user controls

---

## How to Run

1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**
2. Restore NuGet packages (if any)
3. Build the project (`Ctrl + Shift + B`)
4. Run the project (`F5`)

---

## Use Cases

- Algorithm teaching tools
- Performance comparison lab

---

## Project Structure

- Form 1-->User validation
- Form 2-->Menu and control interface that contains a buttons,and each button leads to specific algorithm
- and from form3 to form 20 is about the each algorithm supported in this program
---

## Future Improvements
- Add visual step-by-step walkthroughs
- Integrate complexity graphs
- Add more algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra,etc)
